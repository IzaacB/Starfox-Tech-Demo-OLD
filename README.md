# Starfox in Python:
This is a cool engine/game I am currently working on in python and pygame. *You must have pygame to run this project*

Controls: WASD to move.

Right now there is no actual gameplay, and is more of a model viewer, but in the future I plan to remake the entire first level of Starfox on the Super Nintendo.

Update, Aug. 17th, 2023:

  Added a player controller using WASD to move. My code works, but still needs to be cleaned and optimized. Hoping to do that next commit.
