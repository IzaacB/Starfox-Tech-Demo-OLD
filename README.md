# 3D-Engine
This is a cool engine I am currently working on in python and pygame. *You must have pygame to run this project*

Controls: WASD to move, Arrow keys to go UP, and rotate side-to-side.

Right now there is no actual gameplay, and is more of a model viewer, but in the future I plan to remake the entire first level of Starfox on the Super Nintendo.
